# TRIVIA WEBSITE

## The challenge

This project was created for a Make it Real challenge to develop a trivia website. 
It includes a welcome screen for users to enter their name, two trivia categories with at least three questions each, and three answer options per question. After completing the quiz, users can submit the form to see their results and have the option to play again.
